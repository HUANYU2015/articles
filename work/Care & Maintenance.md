## Use & Care Instructions:

Please read Use & Care Instructions in their entirety before assembling and utilizing your GatherCraft Furniture.

### Keeping Your Furniture Beautiful!

Quality furniture is a significant investment expected to last for years on end. To maintain its beauty and help it last, furniture needs the right care. No finish is totally indestructible. However, with regular care, the finish and materials will last much longer, providing years of enjoyment.

### Tips to Protect and Care for Your Furniture!

1. Avoid placing your furniture in direct sunlight whenever possible, as sunlight causes fading.
2. Avoid extreme temperature changes by arranging furniture away from radiators, heat/air vents, and air conditioning units.
3. Periodically rotate accessories on furniture, so they do not sit in the same spot all the time.
4. Clean up spills immediately. Try blotting rather than a wiping action. 
5. Lift and place objects rather than dragging them across the furniture surface.
 
Wicker Furniture Care: Regular cleaning is recommended for wicker, as it generally cannot endure harsh or abrasive treatments. This also minimizes mildew buildup. To remove dirt and debris, vacuum with a dust-brush attachment or use a dry paintbrush. Clean with a mild soap solution. Scrub, and rinse. Avoid sitting on the wicker when still damp, which can cause sagging. Please always cover the furniture when not in use, and store it properly during inclement weather and the winter/rainy seasons. If wicker furniture is exposed to a rainstorm, please make sure to drain any water that may have accumulated inside the frame.

Frame Care: Because most metals, except aluminum, are subject to rust, metal furniture is usually finished with a layer of clear varnish, paint, or durable powder coating. Use a mild soap solution, and scrub, rinse, and dry. On the outdoor furniture, make sure to drain any water that may accumulate inside the frames after rinsing. 

Outdoor Cushion Care: Please note, our cushions are made from a water-resistant polyester or olefin blend. This does not mean they are waterproof. We do not recommend leaving cushions out in inclement weather, and if cushions become wet, please dry the cushion and the cover separately. Wring out any excess moisture before drying. Our covers are machine washable (gentlest cycle with like colors and cold water), and we recommend separating the cushions covers from the core for any cleaning purposes. Air-dry the cushion covers and cushion cores after wringing out excess moisture and not attempting to wash cushion cores. All of our cushions cores are made of open-cell foams that allow for quick drying. Cushions should be stored and covered when not used to protect them from rain, sunlight, and other staining agents.
 
Glass Tops Care: Rattaner glass tops are 5-millimeter tempered glass 4-5 times stronger than plate glass. Any Rattaner warranties do not cover glass components.

Outdoor Furniture Storage: We highly recommend storing any outdoor furniture during the winter and/or rainy seasons. Before storing your furniture, please ensure all moisture collected in the frame tubes has been drained. When outdoor furniture is not in use, we recommend covering all the furniture to protect it against the elements. If outdoor furniture is exposed to a rainstorm, please make sure to drain any water that may have accumulated inside the frame.
